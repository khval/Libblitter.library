# Libblitter.library

AmigaOS4.1 SDK, there is struct custum, we should able point this to memory, 
and run doBlitter() function to trigger blitter. 

This project is based on Peter Gordon, blitzen v0.3, 
during test, it has proven to work pretty well.

This project is now Freeware, as defined by Peter Gordon.

(first this project tried to use UAE code, but it was 
over complicated for this library, and I did get it work correct.)

I also speculated about wring my own from ground up, but it probably be west of time.
I hope to be forgiven :-)
